    "text": "Venture capital funding plays a pivotal role in bolstering a region’s economy by catalyzing innovation, fostering job creation, and attracting talent.\nVenture capital investment injects vital funding into promising businesses with growth potential, enabling them to scale rapidly. And it holds immense promise for revitalizing rural America’s economy by empowering local entrepreneurs with the resources needed to innovate and grow.\nThough rural areas have traditionally been overlooked by investors, many rural entrepreneurs have managed to access capital that is crucial to transforming their budding ideas into thriving businesses.\nTo explore the venture capital landscape in rural America, we can use the SEC’s Form D to identify the amount of funding received by private businesses in micropolitan areas. A micropolitan area, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, is a region centered around a small urban cluster with a population between 10,000 and 50,000 people. These areas are smaller than metropolitan areas but still exhibit economic and social connections with nearby population centers, making micropolitans an ideal geography for observing venture capital dynamics in rural economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the micropolitan areas that raised the most venture capital in 2022:\n\n\nAnd here are the micropolitan areas that raised the most in venture capital funding per capita in 2022:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicro VC totals (click chart to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicro VC chart (click chart to enlarge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheridan, Heber, and Jackson achieved these outcomes through an abundance of venture capital activity, while the others are driven by a couple companies with very large deals in 2022.\nOf the 81 micropolitans that raised venture capital through Regulation D in 2022, the 10 that raised the most represent 84% of the $1.4 billion in funding that went to micropolitan areas.\n\nThe 10 micropolitans with the most funding per capita varied widely by population size. Grants, New Mexico, had the smallest population (11,620), while the population of Bozeman, Montana, (109,207) was much larger than the others on this list. Heber, Utah was the second-largest micropolitan area in the top 10 (68,075).\n\nEach of these micropolitan areas demonstrates that rural communities are ripe with entrepreneurial spirit and offer investors an abundance of opportunities.\nIf you’d like to dig deeper on the power of direct investment in rural startups, check out our seed fund, the CORI Innovation Fund, which has a growing portfolio of rural tech startups with high-growth potential.

    "title": "Using SEC Form D to estimate venture capital",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The ability of private companies to raise capital serves as a crucial indicator of entrepreneurial activity. The Security and Exchange Commission’s Form D is a publicly available dataset published quarterly that allows researchers to explore the landscape of venture capital investment.\nThe Securities Act of 1933 established the laws governing the sale of securities, including registration with the SEC and mandatory reporting of information that may be pertinent to the public’s investment decisions. Private companies wishing to raise capital from accredited investors may still do so under the exemption, “Regulation D.”\n\nHow Form D works\nRegulation D allows private companies to conduct fundraising rounds without registering with the SEC or regularly submitting information that is required for publicly traded companies. This exemption is the primary mechanism for early-stage ventures to access funding.\nWhen a company raises capital under Regulation D, they must file a Form D, which includes basic information about the company and the fundraising round. This data allows analysts to better understand who is raising venture capital and how much is invested.\nHowever, Form D data is often messy and riddled with human errors. Here are some tips on accessing and cleaning Form D data.\n\n\nCleaning up Form D data\nData going back to Q1 2008 can be downloaded directly from the SEC website. For a more streamlined process, we recommend accessing data in R using the dform package developed by Matt Rogers (download package from matthewjrogers/dform). This allows users to load data by quarter from 2014 to present.\nIf you download the Form D files directly through the SEC and sum the “TOTALAMOUNTSOLD” column the total amount of capital raised through Regulation D in 2022 would be approximately $10.4 trillion, which dramatically overestimates the actual amount of venture capital raised that year. Ernst & Young reported total U.S. venture capital raised in 2022 at $209.4 billion, Statista places it at $241 billion, and Dealroom at $235 billion.\nThis discrepancy is partly due to duplicate entries. The dform package takes a first pass at removing duplicates, reducing the total amount raised in 2022 to $4.9 trilion. This figure still overestimates the amount of venture capital raised by U.S. businesses in 2022. Therefore, once the data is accessed through dform, additional cleaning steps are necessary before the data can provide a realistic picture of the venture landscape.\nFirst, eliminate companies headquartered outside of the U.S. Removing these entries brings the estimate from $4.9 trillion down to $3.7 trillion.\nNext, retain only the latest amendment within a funding round. Companies may file amendments for various reasons. They may need to notify the SEC of additional capital raised within a single fundraising effort or for something as small as correcting a spelling error in a previous filing.\nBecause “TOTALAMOUNTSOLD” is cumulative for a fundraising round, simply summing this column would double-count funds already accounted for in other entries. In order to count these dollars once and attribute the most up-to-date total to the round, we recommend keeping only the latest entry for each funding round. This brings the total down to about $3.67 trillion.\nFinally, remove investment funds. Investment vehicles raising capital on the private market are also required to file a Form D. To distinguish these entities from startups or companies raising operational funds, we recommend separating them from the filings made by traditional businesses. We identify filings made by investment vehicles in the following ways:\n\nThe industry is reported as “Pooled Investment Fund.”\nThe field “ISPOOLEDINVESTMENTFUNDTYPE” is flagged as “TRUE.” This means the purpose of this fundraising round was for a pooled investment fund.\nThe entity name contains the word “FUND.” This indicates that the entity is actually an investment fund.\nThe entity name contains the word “HOLDING.” This indicates that the entity is actually a holding company.\n\nThis brings the final estimate for the total amount of venture funding raised by U.S. companies in 2022 down to about $233B.\nWhile other measures may further refine estimates based on Form D data, using the dform package and following these steps results in a final estimate consistent with other figures for 2022."

Since there are not many tutorials that exist on using jq to manage objects in the GeoJSON family, we hope that these few tricks will help you on your learning journey.\nIn these examples, we are using a GeoJSON file of Vermont census blocks with attributes related to our work on broadband data. While it is not a deeply nested JSON, it is perfect to illustrate some common use cases.\nA quick check lets us know that it is 94 MB. Not “that” big but still decent.\nFirst, let’s see how many features it has. Here’s how we can approximate that:\nThis is a decent estimate, but we are counting some rows at the top and bottom of the file that are not features (try head -n 5 and tail on it if you are curious).\nWe can also use jq:\nThis is the correct number of blocks!
