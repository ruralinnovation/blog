URISA or The **U**rban and **R**egional **I**nformation **S**ystems **A**ssociation is the main association for professionals in the GIS (Geographic information System) and geospatial space. 

We were fortunate enough to be selected to present a portion of our work on broadband infrastructure at the main URISA conference [GIS-Pro-2023, Columbus Ohio](https://gispro2023.sched.com/). 

The title of our presentation was **"Rural areas are overrepresented in unserved areas and underestimated in statistics"** and we utilized FCC NBM data to demonstrate several points:

- The  new dataset (NBM) represents an improvement over the previous one (derived from F477).

- Despite the narrowing gap between rural and non-rural areas, significant disparities still exist.

- The current BEAD definition of an "unserved area" is less suitable for rural areas than for urban areas.
