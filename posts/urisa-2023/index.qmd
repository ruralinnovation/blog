URISA or The **U**rban and **R**egional **I**nformation **S**ystems **A**ssociation is the main association for professionals in the GIS (Geographic information System) and geospatial space. 

We were lucky to be selected to present a part of our works on broadband infrastructure in the main URISA conference: [GIS-Pro-2023, Columbus Ohio](https://gispro2023.sched.com/). 

Our presentations title was **"Rural areas are overrepresented in unserved areas and underestimated in statistics"** and we used FCC NBM data to show that:

- This new data set is an improvement versus the previous one (derived from F477)

- Even if the gap between rural and non rural places was closing it was still significant

- the current BEAD definition of an "unserved area" is less appropriate for rural area than urban's one
