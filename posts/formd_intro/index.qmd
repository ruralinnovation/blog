The ability of private companies to raise capital serves as a crucial indicator of entrepreneurial activity.  The Security and Exchange Commission’s Form D is a publicly available dataset published quarterly that allows researchers to explore the landscape of venture capital investment.  

The Securities Act of 1933 established the laws that govern the sale of securities, which includes registration with the SEC and mandatory reporting of information that may be pertinent to the public’s investment decisions. Private companies that wish to raise capital from accredited investors may still do so under the exemption, “Regulation D.” Regulation D allows private companies to hold fundraising rounds without having to register with the SEC or regularly submit information that is required for publicly traded companies. This is the primary mechanism for early stage ventures to access funding. When a company raises capital under the exemption Regulation D, they must complete a Form D filing, which includes basic information about the company and about the fundraising round. This data allows analysts to better understand *who* is raising venture capital and *how much*.   

The only problem is that the Form D data is messy and riddled with human error!  Here are some tips on accessing and cleaning Form D data.

Data going back to Q1 2008 can be downloaded directly from the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/dera_form-d).  For a more streamlined process, we recommend accessing data in R using the dform package developed by Matt Rogers (download package from [matthewjrogers/dform](https://github.com/matthewjrogers/dform)).  This package allows users to load data by quarter 2014-present.  

If you download the Form D files directly through the SEC and add up the amount raised for each entry (given by the column "TOTALAMOUNTSOLD"), the total amount of capital raised through Regulation D in 2022 would be about $10.4T, which dramatically overestimates the actual amount of venture capital raised that year.  [Ernst & Young](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/growth/q4-2022-venture-capital-investment-trends) places the US total venture capital raised in 2022 at $209.4B, [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277501/venture-capital-amount-invested-in-the-united-states-since-1995/#:~:text=Value%20of%20venture%20capital%20investment%20in%20the%20U.S.%202006%2D2022&text=Although%20the%20companies%20lack%20the,nearly%20241%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.) places it at $241B, and [Dealroom](9https://dealroom.co/guides/usa) at $235B.  This is due, in part, to duplicate entries.  The dform package takes a first pass at removing duplicates, which brings the total amount raised in 2022 down to $4.9T.  This still overestimates the amount of venture capital raised by US businesses in 2022.  Therefore, once the data is accessed through dform, additional cleaning steps are required before the data can paint a realistic image of the venture landscape.

First, remove companies headquartered outside of the US.  Removing these entries brings the estimate from $4.9T down to $3.7T.  

Next, keep only the latest amendment within a funding round.  A company may file an amendment for a variety of reasons.  They may need to notify the SEC of additional capital raised within a single fundraising effort or for something as small as correcting a spelling error in a pervious filing.  Because "TOTALAMOUNTSOLD" is cumulative for a fundraising round, simply summing this column would double-count money that has already been accounted for in other entries.  In order to count these dollars once and attribute the most up-to-date total to the round, we recommend keeping only the latest entry for each funding round.  This brings the total down to about $3.67T.  

Finally, remove investment funds.  Investment vehicles raising capital on the private market are also required to submit a Form D filing.  Because we do not want to confuse these entities with startups or companies raising money for business expenses, we recommend separating them from the filings made by traditional businesses.  We identify filings made by investment vehicles in the following ways:  
1. The industry is reported as "Pooled Investment Fund".  
2. The field "ISPOOLEDINVESTMENTFUNDTYPE" is flagged as "TRUE".  Meaning, the purpose of this fundraising round was for a pooled investment fund.  
3. The entity name contains the word "FUND".  This indicates that the entity is actually an investment fund.  
4. The entity name contains the word "HOLDING".  This indicates that the entity is actually a holding company.  
This brings the final estimate for the total amount of venture funding raised by US companies in 2022 down to about $233B.  

Though there may be other measures that could be taken to arrive at a closer estimate of venture capital funding based on Form D data, using the dform package and following these steps results in a final estimate that is in the ballpark of other estimates for 2022.
