The FCC's public release of the National Broadband Map should, in theory, allow broadband providers to maximize their access to the unprecedented availability of public and private investment funding, but utilizing this data continues to pose challenges for **rural** service providers.

One of our goals at the [Center on Rural Innovation (CORI)](https://ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"} is to support rural stakeholders with practical insights and applications that will empower them to bridge the digital divide and build equitable internet access in underserved communities.

In this post, we aim to:

- Frame the pressing challenges faced by rural broadband providers.
- Explore the wealth of available public data about broadband access and coverage.
- Share the data and tools we’ve developed to help rural broadband providers.

<br />


## The challenge and the opportunity

Access to reliable and high-speed broadband is more critical than ever, yet vast areas of rural America remain underserved. This digital gap limits opportunities for education, healthcare, economic growth, and civic engagement in these regions. With billions of dollars in federal and state funding now available, the ability to analyze and interpret broadband data effectively is paramount. Providers need actionable insights to identify unserved and underserved areas, optimize funding applications, and plan infrastructure investments that meet local needs.

The convergence of new funding opportunities and improved datasets represents an unprecedented opportunity to close the digital divide. By leveraging accurate data and strategic planning, rural broadband providers can maximize their impact and secure funding to expand their services.


## The available data

The following explanation of the data sourced from the FCC is extracted from CORI's [FCC report](https://ruralinnovation.github.io/proj-fcc-report/){.external target="_blank"}, a work-in-progress exploratory data analysis produced by [Olivier Leroy](https://github.com/defuneste){.external target="_blank"}. Please visit the report for a deeper analysis of various aspects of this data.

We rely on two key datasets from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC):

1) **National Broadband Map** ([NBM](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home){.external target="_blank"}):
- Provides granular information on broadband service availability at specific locations, including details about service providers, technology types, and advertised speeds.

2) **Broadband Funding Map** ([BFM](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/home){.external target="_blank"}):
- Offers insights into federally funded broadband infrastructure projects, detailing program boundaries and project-level information.

Both datasets are publicly available under permissive licensing, making them invaluable tools for analyzing broadband coverage and funding opportunities. Licensing information can be found [here](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/about){.external target="_blank"} and [here](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/about){.external target="_blank"}, respectively.[^license_and_attribution]

### What are these two datasets?

On March 23, 2020, the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act or _Broadband DATA Act_ was enacted[^bdc_enacted]. This led to the FCC's creation of the National Broadband Map (NBM) in November 2022[^fcc_nbm_start] and the Broadband Funding Map in May 2023[^bfn_da_links] (documented in July 2023[^bfm_doc]) as the primary methods of publicly releasing these datasets.

#### National Broadband Map (NBM)

The NBM offers detailed broadband availability information:

- Identifies providers and technologies at each location.
- Classifies locations as residential, business, or both.
- Localizes data to census blocks or H3 hexagons.

This dataset is an abstraction of the "Fabric" locations data developed by **CostQuest**. The Fabric provides precise geolocation data for **Broadband Serviceable Locations** (BSLs), which are updated biannually (June and December) with interim updates every two weeks. The exact coordinates for each locations are only inclued in the Fabric dataset, so using the National Broadband Map data we can only link a record for a location to a Census Block (2020 vintage) or H3 hexagon.

!["What's on the national broadband map" Source: [https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData](https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData)](thumbnail.png){#fig-broadbanddata}

Every location is characterized by:

- Who is providing those services (`frn`, `provider_id`, and `brand_name`)
- A description of each of the services (`technology`, `max_advertised_download_speed`, `max_advertised_upload_speed`, `low_latency`)
- Whether the location is characterised as residential, business or both
- Ways to geographically locate it (`state_abbr`, `block_geoid`, `h3_res8_id`)

::: {.callout-tip}
A location (see [What is a BSL?](#what-is-a-broadband-serviceable-location-bsl)) can be covered by multiple Internet Services Provides (ISP) with  potentially different services and technologies. Hence, it can represented in the data can by many "rows".

:::{.aside}
Sometimes the process of collecting those two datasets is called **B**roadband **D**ata **C**ollection (BDC)
:::


#### Broadband Funding Map (BFM)

The BFM provides information about "*broadband infrastructure deployment projects funded by the Federal government throughout the United States*". The public data:

- Categorizes projects by program and geographic boundaries.
- Highlights funding from four federal agencies across 12 programs, including 1,853 projects as of May 2024.
- Provides a critical resource for identifying areas targeted for infrastructure investment.

The information is structured either at the scale of a specific project inside a program or for the whole program. Hence we have characteristics for each project, including their associated boundaries (territories covered) (see [https://ruralinnovation.github.io/proj-fcc-report/fcc_funding.html](https://ruralinnovation.github.io/proj-fcc-report/fcc_funding.html)).


### What is a Broadband Serviceable Location (BSL)? {#sec-BSL}

A Broadband Serviceable Location (BSL) is defined as a location in the U.S. where fixed broadband internet access service is available or can be installed. These include:

- Residential BSLs: Housing units or group quarters as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.
- Business BSLs: Non-residential structures, such as government or nonprofit facilities, on properties without residential locations.

> A broadband serviceable location is defined as “a business or residential location in the United States at which fixed broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.”  A residential BSL includes all residential structures, including structures that are (or contain) housing units or group quarters (as those terms are defined by the United States Census Bureau).  A business BSL includes “all non-residential (business, government, non-profit, etc.) structures that are on property without residential locations and that would expect to demand Internet access service.” (source FCC[^fcc_bsl])

#### Geographic coverage

- **Broadband Availability Data**: Covers all U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories.
- **Funding Map Data**: Varies by program, with coverage reflecting specific project boundaries.


### What is "Unserved" vs. "Underserved"?

The FCC defines broadband access levels as follows:

- Served: Locations with at least one service offering speeds of 100/20 or higher.
- Underserved: Locations with speeds of at least 25/3 but below 100 Mbps download / 20 Mbps upload (100/20).
- Unserved: Locations with maximum advertised speeds below 25 Mbps download / 3 Mbps upload (25/3).

Served, Unserved and Underseved are **overlapping** categories at the **location level**. They can be extended at the "**area level**".

These definitions, rooted in the [FCC's Broadband Speed Benchmark](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark), can be adapted by states to suit local conditions[^pew_list].

## Tools for big broadband analytics

To support rural broadband providers and policymakers, we have developed the following tools:

- [**`cori.data.fcc`**](https://ruralinnovation.github.io/cori.data.fcc/){.external target="_blank"}: `R` package that facilitates the discovery, analysis, and use of FCC public data releases.

- [**Rural Broadband Map**](https://rural-broadband-map.ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"}: Visualizes broadband availability and funding data to identify gaps and opportunities.

- [**Rural Broadband County Summary**](https://broadband-county-summary.ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"}: Summarizes broadband availability and funding data per county (name or FIPS).

- [**Broadband Climate Risk Mitigation Tool**](https://broadband-risk.ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"}: Assesses climate risks posed to broadband infrastructure in order to enhance resiliency.

TODO: ... write more about `cori.data.fcc` ...

TODO: ... in describing the web apps, note that all are served by the [CORI Data API](https://cori-data-api.ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"} (which is provisioned by `cori.data.dcc`)
