The Urban and Regional Information Systems Association — better known as URISA — is the main association for professionals in the GIS and geospatial space.


We were fortunate enough to be selected to present a portion of our work on broadband infrastructure at URISA’s annual conference [GIS-Pro-2023](https://gispro2023.sched.com/) last fall in Columbus, Ohio.

Our presentation, “Rural areas are overrepresented in unserved areas and underestimated in statistics,” utilized [FCC NBM data](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home) to demonstrate several points:

- The new dataset (NBM) represents an improvement over the previous one (derived from F477).

- Despite the narrowing gap between rural and nonrural areas, significant disparities still exist.

- The current BEAD definition of an “unserved area” is less suitable for rural areas than for urban areas.
