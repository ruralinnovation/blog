Mapping rural data is hard! Between sparse populations, inaccurate data, and 
[determining what even counts as rural](https://ruralinnovation.us/blog/defining-rural-america/), mapping 
rural data can be a minefield, but don't fear! In this blog post, I'll cover 
X tips for mapping rural data that will prepare you to confidently tackle your next rural-centric 
mapping project.  


### Normalize your data  

Because rural data is often only available for a handful of geographies 
(e.g., county or tract), the results of statistical analyses 
can significantly vary based on the scale and boundaries of the spatial units 
used (a.k.a the [modifiable area unit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem)). As such, 
standardizing your data into rates or measures instead of raw counts, 
such as using population density instead of total population, is especially useful 
when mapping rural data.

For example, take a look at the two maps below. The spatial trends of broadband service 
are much clearer in the normalized version.

</div>


### Use smaller geographical units when available  

Because rural areas are sparsely populated, regions are often grouped together into 
large geographic boundaries, obscuring nuances in spatial trends. When available, 
consider plotting data a multiple geographic levels to better identify localized trends.

### Separate rural and nonrural color scales  

Mapping rural data means not mapping urban data. Considering urban and rural data 
together often "flattens" rural trends. Rural areas are socioeconomically 
distinct from urban areas and should be considered on their own.

In the case where you want to look at both urban and rural values, consider 
breaking them out into their own facets rather than plotting them together or 
using two color scales.

### Incorporate magnitude  

Because the size of rural geographies is not related to the population within that 
geography, it is often useful to add a measure of visual magnitude in order to 
better highlight spatial concentrations. To that end, I recommend considering cartograms, 
two variants of which you can see below.

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <img style="width: 45%; min-width: 300px;" src="images/cartogram_ncont_pct_rural_pop.png" alt="Cartogram">
</div>

### Use interactivity  

Tooltips (i.e., the info boxes that appear when hovering over an element) are a 
great way to provide users with additional content and can help convey a sense 
of magnitude.

### Consider non-map alternatives  

Just because rural is a spatial concept doesn't mean that maps are always the best choice. 
Consider using a swarm chart.
